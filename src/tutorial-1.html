    <p>You will now learn all necessary basics to get you going with openHAB.<br>
      Right now you are using the "Setup and Maintenance" interface, also called Paper <abbr title="User interface">UI</abbr>
      in the community.</p>

    <details class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
      <summary>This tutorial and also this interface is strictly using new openHAB 2 technology.</summary>
      <p class="mt-2">Please be careful when reading user topics in our community, as those can reference
        older techniques. You want to avoid topics about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sitemaps</li>
        <li>DSL Rules</li>
        <li><i>.thing</i>, <i>.item</i> files</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <h4>What openHAB can do for you</h4>

    <img style="float:left;width: 160px;" src="img/openhab-logo-square.png">
    <p>openHAB is a mature home automation platform that is protocol agnostic,
      meaning it can connect to nearly any home automation hardware on the market today.</p>

    <p>Usually you just need to install an additional piece of software via this web interface,
      use a feature detection of your hardwares capabilities and you can already control your external solution.
    </p>

    <p>Via timers and rules you start automating like turning your lights on when your phone is in WiFi range,
      but only if it is already later than 6 pm. <b>Only your imagination is the limit.</b>
    </p>

    <p>openHAB also <i class="fas fa-heart"></i> and supports <abbr title="Do-it-yourself">DIY</abbr> hardware. We
      speak about this later on
      in the tutorial.</p>

    <h4>About this interface</h4>
    <p>Use this interface to setup new devices, configure existing ones, create automation rules and timers.</p>
    <p>You do not <b>control</b> your devices via this interface. Download the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openhab.habdroid.beta">Android App</a>,
      iOS App, HaBot or use HabPanel instead.</p>
