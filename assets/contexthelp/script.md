<small>You know what an openHAB **Script** is, right?</small>
<small class="blockquote-footer">Your friendly [tutorial](tutorial-1.html) reminder.</small>

A *Script* can be written in any programming language, supported by
[JSR-223](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_for_the_Java_Platform)
(and your Java installation).
An openHAB distribution guarantees that JavaScript (`.js`-files) will work. The community
also invested some time to make Jython (`.py`-files) a viable alternative (Python 2.7 dialect).
