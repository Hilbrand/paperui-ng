<small>You know what an openHAB **Timer** is, right?</small>
<small class="blockquote-footer">Your friendly [tutorial](tutorial-1.html) reminder.</small>

This section lists all configured timers.
It also lists running timers that are not configured directly by you,
but are dynamically created by *Rules* and *Scripts*.

Add a timer by clicking on "Add timer" to your left in the navigation menu.
Remove a timer by clicking on the trash can icon next to its name.

A timer can have a very simple purpose like a "Weekday wake-up timer".
*Rules* and *Scripts* can create timers dynamically for example to
"switch off a lamp, 5 minutes after it has been switched on".

### Tags

Tags can be assigned to timers. You can filter this list by tags.

### Show timers in apps

The Android and iOS App as well as HabPanel will only show timers that are exposed.
